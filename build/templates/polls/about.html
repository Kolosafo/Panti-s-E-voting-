        CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
⦁	Background of the Study.
Election forms a critical process in democratic systems and application of information technologies to their management is a great milestone towards realizing effectiveness and efficiency not only in the results of the election process itself but also in the financial implications that come up with the process.
One basic feature of student unionism is the right to be able to choose their leaders by themselves through the processes of elections. And one basic feature of democracy that cuts across all divides of people is the act of election. Democracy thus encourages individual freedom according to the rule of law, so that people can behave and express themselves as they choose. This not only gives people the chance to choose their leaders, but also air their views on issues affecting their well–being. For a democratic government, public opinion is the most important determinant to establish a government and voting is the process through which people display their opinion and help to setup a democratic government. So the voting system should be reliable, accurate and above all must be transparent.
In the paper or manual voting system, a voter usually goes to the voting stations known as voting units. After direct person-person verification with some IDs, the voter is allowed to vote. The voter is then given a ballot paper which allows a single vote. Once the ballot paper is used, it cannot be reused. However, this ballot paper must also be anonymous as voters do not need to display their identity. I.e. to say, that the ballot paper must identify the voter as being permitted to vote, but not reveal their actual identity. Traditional polling methods trust a lot of parties during the election.
The various drawbacks of a traditional electioneering system are mainly collusion between the electronic officials and contestants, the queuing time, delayed results, overworked tallying officials and the undeniable fact of human errors. The existing voting system did not provide reliable statistics on voting history at al Hikmah University and thus campaigners lacked the ground to apply scientific voter forecasting methods resolving to trial and error methodologies which are error prone and inconsistent.
Reinforcing a one voter one vote policy is difficult in such a situation and malpractices as rigging are not uncommon in manual voting system. It is impossible to completely rule out the need for technology and electronic voting, with the growing number of eligible voters and manual ballot papers involved. It was very easy or manageable in the past because, the institution had few numbers of students (eligible voters). But now the numbers of students have increased and have a high possibility of increasing higher, in the nearest future. It was manageable when we had just few courses in the university especially faculty of applied sciences. But as real as it is now, the institution is growing beyond bounds and the manual system of voting which in so many previous Students’ union government (SUG) elections had caused more than a lot of chaos. The institution, Al Hikmah University, having adopted information technology in various fields of her dealings with students, the student union government should also adopt a new system of voting which is the electronic voting (E-voting) system.
Let’s consider the following points on the existing voting system in the student union government (SUG) of Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences)  : 
⦁	The system that exists currently at Al Hikmah University student Union Government (Faculty of natural and applied sciences), is totally paper based and manual, that takes lots of time and the government has to bear the financial expenses for this purpose.
⦁	The voters are registered just before the poll so the election commission gets some time in hand for making all the necessary arrangements with in this short period of time. They just add the new voters with the previous voters so that the people who are deceased by this time may be considered as the existing voter if the election committee members are not informed. So people may not see the voter’s list as reliable because it contains numerous fake voters.
⦁	Again the authority itself may be corrupted and can allow some fake voters to participate. If any voter stays outside the school premises or misses the registration processes somehow due to prior obligations or unavoidable circumstances, he or she wouldn’t be considered as a voter.
⦁	Sometimes people ruin their votes by stamping on two or more signs mistakenly. This is also a drawback of paper based voting system.
⦁	While casting the votes the acting officers present in the centers marks a voter with a black ink on his or her nail but it is removable. So there is a high chance of casting illegal votes. (I.e. voting more than one time)
All these problems together inspired the thought of developing a new system that will reduce corruption, increase accuracy and fast paced. The concept of electronic voting system comes from this necessity.
Let’s also consider some advantages of the electronic voting (E-voting) system, been the proposed system if implemented.
⦁	Online voting (E-voting) systems’ efforts will be geared towards the minimization, if not the total elimination, of the problems associated with manual systems of elections. A number of mechanisms will be introduced to ensure that time and other resources are efficiently used. 
⦁	Although the initial cost of developing the online voting systems would be high, the long run effects would be that election costs would drastically reduce. 
⦁	Online voting (E-voting) systems would make obsolete the need for ballot boxes and papers, because the system would simulate these. This would mean that printing costs would be reduced by a considerable amount.
⦁	Online voting (E-voting) systems usually tally results as and when votes are cast. This also means that vote counting, which takes a lot of time when done manually, would be eliminated. At the click of a button, results of an election would be displayed.
These and many more are the possible advantages the student union government of (Faculty of natural and applied sciences) Al Hikmah University, will get if the proposed online voting system is accepted and implemented.

⦁	Statement of the Problem:
Using the decade old election system to collect votes from the students is no longer considered efficient due to the various reoccurring errors. The traditional/manual voting system employed in the management of electioneering procedures at the college were not fool proof and were prone to inconsistencies, election malpractices and untimely delivery of results leading to questions about the credibility and validity of the results the returning election officer announces. Much expense was incurred in the production, transportation, storage and destruction of the ballot papers and ballot boxes. So time has come for the paper based primordial voting system which has already proven itself an inefficient and slow procedure to be changed to something more innovative and stress free. Most  voters (Students) are busy with their various academic works and Most of the voters (Students) are living far away from the school environments/campus, been the main voting Centre, some voter’s don't like to wait in queues thus due to these reasons, voters don't visit the pooling booth and Percentage of vote is decreasing.
These days voting system is somehow complicated and time consuming, i.e. this process that involves; voters manually going to a voting centre and shows voter card (Id) to the voting officer. This voting card will be used for authentication during the actual voting process at the voting point. Where they believe that their names are made available and after authentication with this, a voters’ list will be generated for each constituency. The name of such voter will be searched in the list and each voter will then have to go to a polling station and cast their vote by placing their thumb to print against the name or symbol (Logo) of individual or aspirants of their choice At Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences), an indelible ink mark is made on the voter’s right index finger, to show that this person has already voted and so the voter cannot vote again. This is an all time consuming process. Also a large man power is needed for checking voter id, voter list and marking the finger and at each polling station. So election commission has to pay the cost for the required man power.
After much studies on various past SUG elections of the Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences), and their failures in accuracy, security, fairness, adequacies etc. This study therefore laid emphasis on the design of online voting (E-Voting) system for Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences) student’s union government elections.

⦁	Purpose of the Study
The aim of this project is to design an online voting (E-voting) system for Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences) student union government elections. This will help the electioneering committee of the Student Union Government achieve the following:
⦁	To conduct a free and fair election using electronic machines. 
⦁	To replace the current inefficient manual system of voting in the college.
⦁	To ensure credibility in elections by preventing double voting. 
⦁	To also help the student union government reduce the huge expenses incurred from conducting elections.

⦁	Significance of the Study.
In view of the rapid development of computer technology in virtually all fields of operation in Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences)  and its use in relation to information management, it has become important to look into the development of electronic voters registration system to enable the student’s union government to achieve the following;
(a)	 Conduct free and fair election.
(b)	Safeguard data and information in the system.
(c) 	Reduce workload in the process of conducting election.
(d)	Keep accurate record of votes.

⦁	Scope of the Study.
The research work is designed to enable Electoral Commission of the Student Union Government of the Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences), to use electronic device to capture voters’ information. The design will cover some security issues and authentications.
This research covered five (4) departments in Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences) they include;
⦁	Department of biological science,
⦁	Department of chemical and geological sciences
⦁	Department of physical sciences
⦁	Department of computer sciences.

⦁	Limitation of the Study
During the design of this project work, Time factor was the greatest barrier to the successful completion of this exercise since it had to be done within the semester.
The study was limited Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences).

⦁	Research Questions:
In order to arrive at the stated objectives of this study, the researcher attempted to provide answers to the following questions:
⦁	What importance is Online voting (E-voting) system to the student union government elections of Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences)?
⦁	How can online voting (E-voting) system solve the various inadequacies created by the current voting system (Manual voting system) of the student union government elections of Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences)?
⦁	What level of assurance is given to the student union government of Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences), that the proposed system (Online voting system) will be better and more efficient than the current system (manual voting system)?
⦁	What are the major predictors of adopting online voting (E-voting) system in the student union government elections Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences)?

⦁	Organization of Work
The study is structured into five chapters. The first chapter generally introduced the study. The second chapter reviewed relevant literatures which consists brief history of online voting. The third chapter consists of research methodology, under this chapter we talked about research design, area of study, population of the study and sample, data collection techniques, procedure for data analysis etc. The fourth chapter discussed about the data presentation and empirical analysis.

CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.0	Introduction
A voting system or electoral system is a method by which voters make a choice between options, often in an election or on a policy referendum. A voting system enforces rules to ensure valid voting, and how votes are counted and aggregated to yield a final result. Common voting systems are majority rule, proportional representation or plurality voting with a number of variations and methods such as first-past-the-post or preferential voting. The study of formally defined voting systems is called social choice theory or voting theory, a subfield of political science, economics, or mathematics. 
With the proportional representation system several members of parliament are to be elected per constituency. Basically every political party presents a list of candidates and voters can select a list and vote for a political party. Parties are assigned parliamentary seats proportionally to the number of votes they get.
According to Douglas (2003), the purpose of Electronic voting technology is to provide a plain, simple and secret voting process, speed up the counting of ballots, reduce the cost of paying staff to count votes manually and can provide improved accessibility for disabled voters. However, there has been contention, in other institutions, that electronic voting could facilitate electoral fraud and may not be fully auditable. In addition, electronic voting has been criticized as unnecessary and expensive to introduce.
Several countries have cancelled e-voting systems or decided against a large-scale rollout, notably the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Yet electronic voting system has been practicing widely for last two decades. But historically it is seen that it has been using more than last 150 years. The first concept of electronic voting ideas comes from de Brettes. He develops an electronic decision-making telegraph in 1849.
According to Thomas A. (2008), electronic vote recorder was invented by Thomas Edison in 1869. In this system, a signal to a central recorder, listed the names of the members in two columns of metal type headed ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ [Vote Recorder, 2008], and was introduced first automated voting system in 1886.

⦁	Theoretical Literature Review
Several theories and literatures abound to serve as platform for the explanation of the nature, processes, manifestations and importance of voting system. Nurudeen A. Iromini’s theory developed in 1889 dwells on the “categories of voting system” he stated that Voting system can be generally categorized into two major types namely: (a) Traditional Voting System (TVS) and (b) Electronic Voting System (EVS). The two basic voting systems without electronic means are: (i) paper ballot method and (ii) mechanical lever machine method.
The paper ballot system, which is still very common in sub- Sahara Africa, Nigeria not an exemption usually, employs uniform ballots of various stock weights on which the names of all candidates and issues are printed. Voter record their choices, in private by marking or thumb print the boxes next to the candidate or issue choice they select and drop the voted ballot in a sealed ballot box. The paper ballot system was first adopted in the Australian state of Victoria in 1856 and in the remaining Australian states over the next several years, where it became known as the “Australian ballot.” New York became the first American state to adopt the paper ballot for state wide elections in 1889. As of 1996, paper Ballots were still used by 1.7% of the registered voters in the United States. They are used primarily as alternative voting system in small communities and rural areas. In the mechanical lever voting system, the name of each candidate or ballot issue choice is assigned a particular lever in a rectangular array of levers on the front of the machine. A set of printed strips visible to the voters identifies the lever assignment for each candidate issue choice. The levers are horizontal in their unvoted position. And when a voter enters the booth and closes the curtain by means of a lever, the machine unlocks for voting. The titles of all elective offices are listed on the face of the machine along with the party candidates running for each office. Above each name is a lever which, when depressed, indicates a vote for that candidate.
When the voter pulls the curtain open to leave, the machine automatically registers the vote and is cleared for use by the next person. Only one candidate for each office is allowed to be selected during this process. If all mechanical connect ions are fully operational during the voting period and the counters are initially set to zero. The position of each counter at the close of the polls indicates the number of votes cast on the lever that drives it. Interlocks in the machine prevent the voter from voting for more choices than permitted.
In electronic voting system, voter records their secure and secret ballot electronically using modern technological device such as computer and mobile devices where the system can compile and tabulate results automatically. Electronic Voting System (EVS) can be described as a voting system by which election data are recorded, stored, and processed electronically, primarily as digital information. Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) encompasses both electronic means of casting a vote and counting the votes. Theoretical study about existing electronic voting techniques was given as well as requirements and security issues of modern electronic voting systems. He also presented modern voting solutions including security functionalities provided by the system, the cryptographic techniques used and some threats and attacks to the systems.
Richards and Drake’s characteristics theory:
According to Richard S. and Drake P.M. (1985), voting systems must be transparent and comprehensible enough that voters and candidates can readily accept the results of an election. For a voting system to be considered transparent and comprehensible, some important criteria must be met: First, the anonymity of voter’s ballot must be preserved in order to ensure that the voter is safe when voting against a candidate and also to guarantee that voters have no evidence that proves which particular candidates received their vote. It is believed that the existence of such evidence could allow votes to be bought. Secondly, the voting system must be tamper-proof in order to prevent a wide range of attacks, including ballot stuffing by voters and incorrect tallying by insiders (poll officials). Thirdly, it should be user-friendly. This means that it should be easily comprehensible and usable by the entire voting populace. Electronic voting (e-voting) is one of the pillars of the democracy, which refers to the use of computers or computerized voting equipment’s to cast and tabulate ballots in an elect ion in a trustable manner.
Several works have been done in the area of electronic voting system for the monitoring of election process on our campuses. The US has been experimenting with different forms of electronic voting system for a number of years. Currently, numerous voting technologies have been implemented across the country. In the year 2004 presidential election, around 40 million votes were cast electronically in polling sites. Voting over the internet on the other hand is met with great skepticism. Fingerprints identification was integrated into electronic voting machine using microcontroller. The use of fingerprint to identify voters not only guarantees the voters’ anonymity but also ensures a one-man one-vote system. In recent years, electronic voting systems have been deployed in all US elections. Despite the fact that cryptographic integrity checks are used in most systems, several reports have documented serious security vulnerabilities of electronic voting terminals. An overview of the typical security and election vulnerabilities found, in most, if not all, electronic elect ion systems were also presented.
Also, in the paper presented by Richards S. and Drake P.M., he analyzed the security considerations for a remote internet voting systems based on the system architecture of remote internet voting. The feasibility of successful carrying out of remote electronic voting over the existing internet infrastructure that conforms to the requirements of a public election process was also examined using Delov-Yao Threat Analysis Model. Multifactor authentication and cryptographic hash function methods was used to improve the authentication and integrity of e-voting system.
In Belgium, a new prototype i.e. an improved paper-based voting system, developed by a consortium led by Smartmatic was employed. According to paper presented in Taita Taveta University College, he described the process undertaken to achieve development and deployment of a web based system to promote free and fair democratic electioneering process. The system was developed using the incremental prototyping due to the adaptive nature of web based applications and the system proved that a computerized solution is possible with elimination of human related faults that are a commonplace in employment of human clerks to manage the election process.


⦁	Empirical Literature Review
This category of voting “Electronic voting” is potentially broad, referring to several distinct possible stages of electronic usage during the course of an election. Electronic voting is a voting process where electronic machines are used to facilitate vote without using paper ballots. 
In defining the word online voting (E-voting), this study takes a look at various literature concepts on e-voting.
According to Cetin kaya and Cetin kaya (2007), e-voting systems include three actors: voter, registration authorities and tallying authorities. Voters have the right for voting, and registration authorities register eligible voters before the “election day”. These authorities ensure that only registered voters can vote and they vote only once on the election’s day and tallying authorities collect the cast votes and tally the results of the election. Tallying authorities may be counter, collector and /or tallies.
             Kahani, (2005) the literature presents four categories of e-voting, depending on the level of security, privacy, and trust that they maintain; these categories are e-commerce, trust authority, individually verifiable and universally verifiable. In the first type there is no security except possibly on the communication channels. Ballot box stuffing is tolerated, the voter's privacy is not maintained and vote tampering is not prevented. It is suitable for Internet polling site. In trusted authority systems the election officials are trusted to maintain the integrity of the election, voter privacy is somehow maintained and vote tampering is prevented in these systems. This type of voting systems is suitable for small-scale voting, for which the election official can be trusted. In individually verifiable systems conducting the e-voting process is secured, efficient and private elections are possible, the disadvantage of this type is that the voter is responsible for insuring that his vote has been accounted for in the final election tally, these systems are impractical for civic elections as no independent observer can verify the elections. In the last category of Internet voting, universally verifiable, anybody can verify the election without compromising voter's privacy. Provision of this level of protection is difficult. These systems can only be used for yes/no election due to contradictions among requirements.
Cetin kaya and Cetin kaya, (2007), e-voting system should also involve four phases: Voters register themselves to registration authorities and the list of eligible voters is compiled before the election day, on the election day registered voters request ballot or voting privilege from the registration authorities and the registration authorities check the credentials of those attempting to vote and only allow those who are eligible and registered before. Voter casts his vote and finally the tallying authorities count the votes and announce the election result.
According to Storer and Duncan, (2004) Yarmouk University (YU) is the second oldest university in Jordan and account for more than 30,000 students in 11 colleges and 53 departments. The university conducts a yearly election of students’ council, where such event is considered the most important and might lead to critical disputes based on political and social issues. This study tried to explore how students will perceive electronic systems used in an election process and what factors will influence such process. The study utilized the technology acceptance model (TAM) with some extensions to it. Based on the literature e-voting refers to the use of computer or computerized voting equipment to cast ballot in an election, this term sometimes is used more specifically to refer to voting that takes place over the Internet. 
According to Toe, Srivastava and LiJiang, (2008), "E-government is the use of information and communication technologies and the Internet to enhance the accessibility to and delivery of all facets of government services and operations for the benefit of citizens, businesses, employees and other stakeholders is continuously transforming public services delivery system". 
Johnson, (2006), On the other hand, e-democracy is defined as “the use of the Internet as a medium for democratically selecting political leaders, public policies, or both". 
According to Bozinis and Lakovou, (2005), E-democracy has two main objectives; the first one is to provide citizens with the accessibility to information and knowledge about the political process, services and choices available; and the second one is to make possible the transition from passive information access to active citizen participation. The main characteristics of e-democracy are dissemination of political information, e-voting and participation in e-decision making. 
According to Kitlan and Joseph, (2008) and Bhatnagar, (2004) when identifying e-democracy within e-government categories, it fits most under government-to-citizens (G2C).
2.3.1	Why Use E-Voting:
According to Data-monitor (2008), election voting machines have provided a number of benefits to the election process. For example, direct recording electronic machines can be equipped with audio or tactile devices that allow disable citizen to cast ballot independently, they also help conduct election in more efficient and effective manner, like reducing the cost associated with printing ballot and hiring extra polling staff. Voting machines can also spit out election tallies much quicker and more accurately than exhausted polling station staff; they reduce human errors in generating election result and also reduce the cost of conducting election. So the major benefits of e voting could be summarized in the following points: reduced costs, increased participation and voting options, greater speed and accuracy placing and tallying votes, greater accessibility and flexibility for the disable.
Bishop and Wagner, (2007) as we pinpointed few benefits of e-voting, some risks are associated with using and depending on electronic systems. Programming errors can be very simple like adding semi colon in the wrong place can completely change a program. There are many risks experienced during the development stage of any system, product delivery, maintenance between elections and the pre-and post-election intervals. The greatest threat identified involves a person gaining access to a voting system and interring malicious code into the voting system software. This malicious code could exploit vulnerabilities in the voting software to spread virally from machine to machine causing voting machine to fail to record votes, failing to comply with legal requirement and calculating vote totals in a way that is inconsistent with legal requirements. Applying technology to solve one problem may introduce other problems. For example, E-voting systems are introduced to eliminate paper and many other problems, but without a paper copy, the voters cannot check that their votes are correctly recorded and cannot independently validate votes’ totals.
According to Gerlach, (2009) electronic voting can be secure and confidential as paper-based voting. However, to work properly, such systems must first incorporate seven design principles. The first is proven security; all protocols and techniques must be mathematically proven secure. Second, trustworthy design responsibility; government security agencies should be responsible for creating secure voting system. Third, source code; must be published and made publicly accessible. Forth, vote verification; it should be possible to verify that all votes have been correctly accounted for in the final election tally. Fifth, voters’ accessibility; system should be accessible to all and easy to use. Sixth, ensure classification: techniques like onion routing must be used to ensure classification. And finally, expert oversight; team of experts selected and approved by all major parties taking part in election.

2.3.2	E-Voting Experiences around the World
Klaussner (2007), and Towns (2008), the State of California allows e-voting machines to be used only under strict conditions. Polling stations won't be able to have more than one of those systems in place, and county registrars will have to take steps such as reinstalling the software and firmware for the devices and resetting them encryption key. E-voting systems were used by one quarter to one-third of California voters in November elections year 2006. But during state sponsored review of the machines and their source code, a team of penetration tester found 15 security problems, including the ability to exploit flaws in windows.
            Songini, (2007), in the case of Florida State, the Florida legislature passed a bill that would require all voting districts in the state to replace most touch-screen voting systems with optical scan devices. The bill estimates the cost of replacing the touch-screen systems at $18.5 million.
            Seligson, (2008), in America's voting systems shift from lever machines and hand-counted paper to optical scanners and touch screens with printed voter-verified paper audit trails and the system served an estimated 133 million voters on Nov.4
Towns (2008), Vuyst and Fairchild, (2005), On the other hand, and in the European Union countries, e-voting was introduced as a part of the federal and provincial elections in Belgium in November 1991, when two cantons were selected for an experiment in e-voting. Through a law of 11 April 1994, this experiment was broadened and institutionalized to 20% of all voting areas and since 1999, 44% of all voting is registered electronically to attain 100% by 2006 elections.
The main objectives of Belgium government from shift to e-voting system are difficult to manage and control manual voting, reduced the costs, announce the result earlier and make the result more accurate.
2.3.3 	Student’s Council Election Cases
Normally, the elections of students’ council at any institution and anywhere in the world, doesn’t elicit much attention. Cases of student council elections using e-voting system: 
(Ramos, 2006) In Brazil, the student council elections project was developed in a public school located in Serra Azul, and it includes the electronic voting system, developed and used by the student and some. Also, Cleveland high schools are choosing their student council leaders using e-voting machine.
According to Alrai Newspaper, (2009), In Jordan, the issue is different, as it is used as a yardstick to measure present and future trends of the Jordanian kingdom. Also, there is great emphasis on prestigious image of the position within the university society more than public service for the community. A student candidate in  Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences)  must have the following conditions (www.alhikmahuniversity.edu.ng) he/she should have an accumulated average not less than 60%, must have at least a 12 credit hour load through the semester (a full time student), must not have less than 36 credit hour to graduate from the university, and did not have any warnings or punishments during his/her study at the university. In the year 2009, a large fight broke out at Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences) University between students. This resulted in physical damages to windows, cars and buildings on campus, as well as some injury of people, including a security guards, the reason cited for the fight was student’s elections.
According to Rawashda, (2009), the objectives of the students’ council election can be summarized in the following points:
⦁	Represent all students in the department and act as a voice for the interests, opinions, and concerns of that student body of the department.
⦁	Act as an intermediary between students and the faculty and administration in the department.
⦁	Represent the student body in faculty and staff committees and meetings. Student council election process: In order to vote, a student must be listed in the enrollment services office.
Rawashda, (2009), Voters must sign the student print-out. Election administrator then highlights each voter’s name as he/she votes. Once a name has been highlighted and signed, the student may not vote again. Voter is given numbered election ballot. Voting will be by secret ballot. Voter fills out ballot (inside the polling booth) and places his/ her ballot inside the ballot box. 

2.3.4	STUDENT’S COUNCIL ELECTION CASES IN NIGERIA
AMBROSE ALLI UNIVERSITY (AAU) Ekpoma, Edo State Nigeria:
According to Ekpoma (2016), as part of efforts to fully digitalize its operations, the Ambrose Alli University (AAU), Ekpoma-Edo State has conducted Students’ Union Government (SUG) elections, using Electronic Voting system. With the voting system, students voted from the comfort of their homes, using smart phones, computers, pads and other relevant electronic gadgets. The election produced Oribhabor Cletus as president and Okogbe Rich Oladele as secretary of the institution’s apex student union body. The Dean of Students Affairs, Prof. Don Akhilome described the introduction of e-voting as another landmark achievement marking the transformation Ambrose Alli University. He said the idea was conceived by the administration of the current vice-chancellor, Prof. Ignatius Onimawo, to eliminate violence and rancour that usually characterize student elections in the institution. “All over the world, our students who are validly registered members of the union are voting right now. There is no place where students are congregating. So there is no pushing, fighting or quarreling; and transparency is also guaranteed”, he stated during the election. The Spokesperson of the institution, Mr. Edward Aihevba explained that the voting system was in line with avowed commitment of the vice-chancellor, Prof. Onimawo, to putting the university in global digital platform. According to him, the university was already conducting its senate meetings and examinations, electronically, just as students results were now been uploaded on the internet, hence transcript could now be transmitted electronically. President of the National Association of Nigeria Students (NANS), Comrade Aruna Kadiri who was part of the observers, described the voting system as a laudable achievement, as it was free of hitches and manipulations. “I will want to recommend it for other universities and the nation at large, because if we are able to achieve this in our campuses and in our country Nigeria, then I’ll say democracy has taken a new dimension”, he stated. 
RIVERS STATE UNIVERSITY (RSU) PORT-HARCOURT, RIVERS STATE NIGERIA:
King Onunwor (2017), As the global society gets closer to the appreciation and usage of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools, its outcome has continued to be commended among users.
The latest came from the students of Rivers State University (RSU), last Friday after the successful e-voting system that produced a new body of the Students Union Government (SUG).
Speaking with The Tide in Port Harcourt, Wednesday one of the students, Emperor Nnaoma, said that the e-voting system was a key factor in the smooth process of the exercise.
He noted that the outcome would have been counter-productive, if it was conducted. Nnaoma pointed out that the powers that be would have also hijacked the process to the detriment of the students.
The 400-level law  students, was of the view that e-voting system should be adopted to other similar processes in the nation, not only to avoid chaos but to enhance smooth electoral system. Another student, Geoffrey Amadi, who praised the initiators of the e-voting formula, said it was second to none, sequel to its accuracy and devoid of mal-practice.
He pointed out that the electronic voting system calmed the SUG election, as students were busy voting via their cell phones and other internet enabled devices.
The student cum comedian also wants the handlers of the site to ensure that subsequent exercises are conducted at particular centre or unit.
Maduagu argued that the idea of voting from every point was not the best as it has the tendency of tainting the process.
Earlier, he has called on the SUG President-elect, Comrade Bestman Azunwu to among other things; think on how best to encourage ICT usage among the students, as he wished him successful tenure in office.
The Tide was also told that the site was hacked by some students. 

AL HIKMAH UNIVERSITY (HUI), KWARA STATE NIGERIA:
According to Babatunde (2014), With an E-Voting System, the students of University of Ilorin have elected new executives of the Student Union Government SUG for the 2014-2015 Session. The election which was done via the e-voting system saw Ahmed Yakub Ishowo, a 300 Level Mathematics student; emerge as the SUG President-elect after getting 919 votes. 
The Chairman of the electoral body, Pro. Mahmood yakubu, described the e-portal voting system as an innovation that affords students the opportunity to vote for their candidates of choice without necessarily having to leave the confines of their classrooms or hostel rooms. The system removed the cumbersome nature of students having to go and queue to be able to vote, thereby missing their lectures in the process. Before the Election Day, students were required to complete their voter’s registration through the University portal. On Election Day, voting commenced at exactly 7.00a.m. And ended around 6.00p.m. At the end of the election, the ISEC Chairman, Mahmood, announced the results at Lecture Theatre 1 in the presence of all the agents of the various aspirants, security men and campus journalists. Also present during the announcement of the result were the Dean and Sub-Dean of Student Affairs, Dr. S.B. Suraju 
In conclusion, the context of this work defines e-voting system as encompassing several different types of voting embracing both electronic means of counting votes. It also includes the use of punched cards, optical scan voting systems and specialized voting kiosks (including self-contained direct-recording electronic voting systems or DRE). This system is an innovation that affords students the opportunity to vote for the candidates of their choice without necessarily having to leave the confines of their classrooms or hostel rooms. The system will remove totally the cumbersome nature of students having to go and queue to be able to vote, thereby missing their lectures or their various individual activities in the process.
This research implies that since there have been series of successes recorded, about e-voting, the system surely will if adopted by the student union government of federal college of education (technical) omoku, eradicate totally violence, High expenses and time wasted in carrying out elections manually.


CHAPTER THREE
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.1	Rapid Application Development
In course of this study, the Rapid application Development Methodology (RAD) is going to be used. Before going further the researcher will like to give brief description of what RAD is all about Based on the researcher understands. RAD is a software development process that uses minimal planning in favor of prototyping, RAD according to designed to give a much faster development and higher quality results than the traditional life cycle. The RAD is manila designed to make use of the most recent powerful software, and uses prototype.
According to (Whiten. 2004), RAD is referred to as a merger of different structure.
Techniques most especially the data information, which uses prototype in their software system development. There are so many Rapid application developments which include software prototyping. We are basically going to use the software prototyping and a little of iterative development process.
3.1.1	Software Prototyping
Software prototyping is referred to as an activity, in which during a certain state of software development an incomplete version of the program is developed. Prototyping only stimulates a very few aspect of the program features and in most cases is different from the main program. The main aim of software prototyping is to allow users of the software to evaluate the developer project proposal or the design of the eventual product by trying them out rather than interpreting the project design verbally for the end users. There are so many types software prototyping, but in course of this project, we are going to focus on only prototyping which is “throwaway prototyping” (also known as closes ended prototyping). This is because throwaway prototyping aims at building a very close ended prototyping in a structural manner, which is continually been refined and rebuilt. Throwaway prototyping acknowledges the fact that the developer does not understand the system’s full requirement, however this method builds

⦁	System Design 
The online voting system (OVS) or (E-voting system) is designed to give students of Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences), easy, fast and reliable means of voting and been voted for in the student union government elections every academic session.
The system is a window-based system, designed for the free and fair conduct of student union government elections Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences).
3.3	Proposed System Design:
We propose to develop an online voting system. This system is aimed at overcoming the drawbacks of the currently used voting system, “the traditional paper and ballot voting system. Upon the implementation of this system, it is going to reduce the cost, effort and time taken to conduct Elections over a period of time.
The web-based online voting system will use a login window, that will need thorough authentication before it can allow user access, the authentication can only be done after students have registered with the system, with its password and user details saved in the system database, the proposed system is going to use the MD 5 encryption algorithm to store user’s password in the database, because it is not advisable to store access codes on plain text.  The proposed system is going to be divided into two main module, the administration staff module and user/student module.  The administration staff model is granted access to the system automatically using the admin password whereas the user/student model can only allow them access after they have registered and saved their access details in the system database.
The proposed system is to use the three tier display structure which includes the model, the view and the controller (MVC).  The model interacts directly with the database and the controller, and the controller interacts directly with the view. Both the controller and the view are segments of the three tier presentation (MVC), fully based on the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) features of the Yii framework.  Below is a brief illustration depicting typical MVC model interaction as used in the proposed system:

 



3.4	The System Architecture: 










3.5	The Home Page
This page views, information about the SUG of that academic session and the election. In this page there is a hypertext or navigation, in form of a dialog box, bearing a request for “login” and beneath this dialog box or navigation is the “signup” hypertext.
 

3.6	The Login/Sign-Up Page
In this page, a form is displayed right in the middle part of the homepage, for a registered user to gain access to the voting platform and the full website. It also provides a hypertext “sign-up” for new users to sign-up and gain login pin, to be able to access the voting platform. By clicking on the sign-up page, the system redirects the user to the registration platform, where the user is asked to provide necessary information about him/herself as a student.
 





3.7	 Registration Form
This page registers each user, providing various fields for them to fill in their personal data. When the various fields of the form are completely filled, the user is then asked to click on the “submit” button, to finally submit the form to the administrator. In filling this form, the user is asked to provide his/her password; this password when registered becomes the user’s unique identity to access the voting platform.
 







3.8	The Aspirants’ Information Page
This page views diverse information about the aspirants e.g. pictures, personal data, departments, schools, manifesto’s etc. Information about aspirants/candidates for various positions/offices is displayed in a very simple and linear way. A picture of the aspirant/candidate is displayed and hypertext “information” is included beneath the picture. Once this hypertext is clicked, the full information page of that aspirant/candidate is displayed and right at the bottom of the information page there’s also a hypertext “vote”. Once the user clicks on the vote button, it redirects the user to the voting platform, where the user is to vote for the candidate who owns the information preceding the voting page. 



  





3.9	Voting Page
This page displays a picture of a ballot box and paper entering inside of it. Two buttons are displayed in this page, one at the right and the other at the left hand side of the ballot box. The first button is to vote while the other is for confirmation of vote. The user is expected to click both buttons before his/her vote is captured by the system. If any of the buttons is left out, before logging out or leaving the page, that vote automatically becomes void.

 


















CHAPTER FOUR
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF SYSTEM
4.1	Proposed System Features:
The proposed system is made up of the following components: the homepage, login/signup page, registration form, aspirant’s information page, voting page.
4.2	System & User Interaction Model:
The interaction between the user and the system is illustrated using uml diagram (Use case). See interaction model below;

 








Fig.2 User Interaction model 1. (Adim. Staff)


 





Fig.3 User Interaction model 2. (2 or more students)

4.3	Logical Designs/Model:
 A sequence diagram is used to illustrate the basic functional flow of the entire system. See components functional flow below;







Fig. 4 Functional model 1, (users/students Registration)
 
 Fig. 5 Functional Model 2, (login)







Fig. 6 Functional Model 3, (voting)

4.4	Structural & Work Flow Models/Designs:
Uml class and activity diagrams were used to model the work flow and structural design of the proposed system. Class diagram was used to state the class, its attributes & possible operations and relationship.  Activity diagram was used to the stage by stage work flow of the proposed system. See the activity diagram models below:



 









 Fig.7 Work Flow Model 1; User Registration








 Fig.8 Work Flow Model 2; login







Fig.8 Work Flow Model 3; aspirant’s information/voting
4.4	Description of the System 
The system allows users to make inputs into the system through the use of the interfaces that have been created. The system provides the following input services; 
The system validate the username and password entered by the Admin to check if they match and have the authorization to access the system and carry out functions they intend to do but with the Voter the system asks for the username and Short Code as password sent to his or her phone via email or SMS prior to voting for further verification. 
If the details entered are correct for the Admin the system takes him or her to the Admin Dashboard which gives him the opportunity to access other pages like; 
● 	Manage Aspirant page 
● 	Add new voter 
● 	Update voter 
● 	Stop Election 
● 	Start Election 
● 	Delete Aspirant etc. 
In the case of the Voter, the system takes him or her to the voting panel where he or she can vote. If the credentials entered are not valid for both the Admin and the Voter, the system displays an error message which re-opens the login section or form for the users to re-enter the correct or valid credentials. The system counts the number of failed login attempts to the system. If the failed login attempts exceed three (3) times, the system sends a text message to the registered phone number of the user indicating the login attempts. The user can then request for a new password short-code via the prior registered e-mail address. The Electoral Commission Chief Loads all aspirant onto the system by capturing their names, position they aspire to, their phone number and their picture. The system generates a unique code for each aspirant and sends the code and the details of aspirant to the aspirant via SMS to the aspirant’s phone with a confirmation request. When the aspirant confirms receipt of the SMS by replying “OK”, the system adds him/her to the Aspirants page. The Electoral Commission Chief also load all valid student’s ID, Name, Level, Department, Society, valid mobile phone number and a Picture. On the day of election, the Electoral Commission Chief activates the system to allow students to log into the system in a secured network environment to vote. Once one student log in to the system on the day of the election to cast his/her vote, the system locks the Electoral Commission Chief out of the system. The Electoral Commission Chief can only get into the administrative portal by clicking on the “End of Election” Button, in which case the election ends and no student can log in unless the entire system is reset for the next election period. The Students enters their ID number as user name and the system sends a unique code to the phone number of the student. The system request the student to enter the unique code sent to the phone number. The system validates the code entered by the Student. Once it is validated the system take the student to the voting portal (Figure 10). The system allows for a maximum of three trails at each validation stage after which the system locks the ID number for an hour. Other IDs would however work on the same system within that period. The voting portal displays the entire aspirant under the position they aspire to eg: Speaker, Women Commissioner, and Governor for the student’s society, etc. The student selects an aspirant for each position. For Verification and Authentication purposes the “vote” button is only activated only when a student selects an aspirant for each position. Once a student vote, the system logs him/her off the system and locks his/her ID from logging into the system again. The system calculates or counts the total vote for each aspirant once the EC chief clicks on the “End of Election” button. The system then sends the collated results for each position to all aspirants for that position.
CHAPTER FIVE
SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.0	Introduction
This chapter concludes this study with the following headings: Summary of the study carried out, conclusion would be drawn from the analysis and recommendation to alleviate the problems identified in course of the study.
5.1	Summary
This research work focuses on designing an online voting (E-voting) system Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences), student union government elections. The system is designed to give students Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences), easy, fast and reliable means of voting and been voted for in the student union government elections every academic session.
This study was based on the crucial causes and lapses found in the manual system of voting. In course of this study, the Rapid application Development Methodology (RAD) was used. This is to help develop a reliable system with an easy interaction between the user and the system. Four research questions were raised to help achieve the importance and possible need of the proposed system
.
5.2	Conclusion
There is no doubt that a comprehensive Electronic Voting System will enhance the standard of elections in Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences), student union government. Literarily speaking, the future is in our hands. While accepting that there are problems with elections in Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences), student union government, it is equally true to say that the students must work hard to overcome them. Election is a process involving many stake holders who are expected to perform their expected functions at the right time. These stakeholders are the union government, the electoral committee, various students’ parties, security agents, leaders of the school community and the electorate. The stake is certainly not an easy one, but with proper focus and hard work electronic voting process can be achieved.
To sum up the discussion above, this Research clarifies the requirements and key elements of E-voting system and our implementation provide the following features. To begin with, the accuracy of voter’s identity and ballot card are ensured with this voting system. Next, voter’s identities are not written in the ballot card to protect voter’s privacy and confidentiality. This system will validate whether the ballot card is to protect voter’s privacy and confidentiality. The system will validate whether the ballot card is authorized or not, to make sure only legal user can vote, and voter’s authorities are limited in order to prevent his violation.

5.3	Recommendations
For credibility, integrity and accountability of the electoral committee, to ensure a free and fair electoral process in Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences) student’s union government, it is recommended that the commission should embrace and integrate Electronic Voting System to the current voting system.
Apparently, the adoption of EVS to the electoral system of Al Hikmah University (Faculty of natural and applied sciences) student’s union government elections in this information age will cause a rapid standard shift which will directly or indirectly affect every student within and outside the campus. The student’s union government should once more canvass for the full use of the Electronic Voting System. With the Electronic Voters Register now in place, the students should all go out to support the system. However the student’s union government SUG should always employ competency in carrying out any future electoral activities. The mind set of electoral officers need to be alienated to the new order.
